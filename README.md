Welcome to this repository hosting a simulation of Conway's Game of Life, a cellular automaton devised by mathematician John Conway. This simulation is implemented using C# and Windows Forms to provide an interactive graphical user interface.

Project Overview:

Conway's Game of Life is a zero-player game that evolves over time based on a few simple rules. The game consists of a grid of cells, each of which can be alive or dead. The state of the grid in the next generation is determined by the current state according to the following rules:

    A live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies (underpopulation).
    A live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation (survival).
    A live cell with more than three live neighbors dies (overpopulation).
    A dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell (reproduction).

Repository Content:

    Source Code: Complete source code for the simulation, including the logic for evolving the grid and the GUI for user interaction.
    Executable: An executable file to run the simulation and explore the emergent behaviors of Conway's Game of Life.
    Documentation: Detailed documentation explaining the implementation and how to interact with the simulation.
    Visualizations: Snapshots and/or videos showcasing different patterns and behaviors in the Game of Life.

Technologies Used:

    C#
    Windows Forms
